Live for ourselves for showing that to others
Hope is the only thing stronger than fear
You have my heart, keep it safe

LOVE is like WAR
Easy to start...
Difficult to end...
Impossible to forget

Sometimes memories sneak out of my eyes and roll down my cheeks.

You're the most expensive thing that I have.

For every negative
there is a positive

The trouble is you think you have time.

the health of mother who stood bent on world
Instead of success in a base I hate, I prefer to loose in a base I enjoy.

Always the huge blaze is from small spunkie

if you can’t be kind, be quiet

I’m in desperate need of a 6 month vacation… Twice a year

Silent people have the loudest minds
I’m not perfect but I am Loyal.
