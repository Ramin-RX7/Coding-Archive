 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nKilled the demons of my mind\nEver since you came around\nWe're a river, running wild\nHow could I have been so blind?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI just live a fast life\nForget about the past time\nI numb out to escape my feels\nAnd friendships only pass by\nShow up, gone, like strobe lights\nBut with you, I feel something real\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile\n'Til the day I die\nOh, I need you by my side, we get high on life\n'Til the day we die\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\n\n[Pre-Drop]\nAnd I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile\n'Til the day I die\n[Drop]\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\n\n[Verse 2]\nThrough my fingers, out of sight\nHow could I have let you go?\nCutting corners, turning stones\nBut I can only see your ghost\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI just live a fast life\nForget about the past time\nI numb out to escape my feels\nAnd friendships only pass by\nShow up, gone, like strobe lights\nBut with you, I feel something real\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile\n'Til the day I die\nOh, I need you by my side, we get high on life\n'Til the day we die\n\n[Post Chorus]\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\n[Pre-Drop]\nOh, I need you by my side, we get high on life\n'Til the day we die\n\n[Drop]\nHigh on life 'til the day we die\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile\n'Til the day I die\nOh, I need you by my side, we get high on life\n'Til the day we die26EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
